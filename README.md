  ## Description:
  This application was designed in order for a user to generate a simple logo with their initials or any other desired three-lettered text. The user is able to pick between a square, circle, or trianlge for the shape of the logo and can pick the color. The application accepts the name of the color or its hexadecimal number. Once all the prompts are answered by the user, an SVG file is generated with the appropriate image.
